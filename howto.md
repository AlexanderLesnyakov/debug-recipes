How to debug effictively?
-------------------------

When I start debugging a problem I usually keep follow the steps described below:

1. Focus on the given problem completely (avoid any distractions) 
2. Collect all evidence you can and describe the problem in a text file
3. Prepare a hypothesis and write it down (keep in mind that the least probable hypothesis is usually the least probable :) - leave it for later times)
4. Test your hypothesis - while testing remember to write down the results you received in the text file
5. If your hypothesis is wrong move back to point 2
