How to debug effictively?
-------------------------

When I start debugging a problem I usually keep follow the steps described below:

1. Focus on this case and nothing else
2. Collect all evidence you can and describe the problem in notepad
3. Prepare a hypothesis and write it down (keep in mind that the least probable hypothesis is usually the least probable :) - leave it for later times)
4. Test your hypothesis - while testing remember to write down the results you received
5. If your hypothesis is wrong move back to point 2
