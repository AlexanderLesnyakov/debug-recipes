How to debug effictively?
-------------------------

When I debug a problem I usually follow the steps described below:

1. Focus on a given problem completely (avoid any distractions) 
2. Collect all evidence in **a problem folder** (I usually name the folder with a date and a problem title, eg. *20151101_deadlock-in-myapp*) and create **a text file** with the problem description
3. Prepare a hypothesis and write it down (keep in mind that the least probable hypothesis is usually the least probable :) - leave it for later)
4. Test your hypothesis - while testing remember to write down the results you received in the text file
5. If your hypothesis is wrong move back to point 3
